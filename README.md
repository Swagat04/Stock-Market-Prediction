# Stock-Market-Prediction
This prediction is only short-term. The moment you try to predict for multiple days like the next 30-days or 60 days, this fails miserably. Not because our LSTM model is bad, but, because Stock markets are highly volatile. So, donâ€™t bet your money simply on this model! Do some research and then use this model as a complementary tool for analysis!
